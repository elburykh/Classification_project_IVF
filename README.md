# Classification_project: Predicting live birth after one or more complete cycles of IVF.

In Vitro Fertilization is an assisted reproductive technology commonly referred to as IVF. 

 > IVF is the process of fertilization by extracting eggs, retrieving a sperm sample, and then manually combining an egg and sperm in a laboratory dish. 
1% of births per year in the UK are a result of IVF treatment. The global IVF market size was valued at USD 14.2 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5% from 2021 to 2028.

## The Goal of the Project
This capstone project is going to focus on predicting a successful live birth as a result of an IVF cycle. It will specifically be looking at the IVF procedures which had at least 1 embryo transfer performed. The success rate for procedures that have reached this stage is around 45%. 

Predictions will be performed using machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree Classifier and K-nearest Neighbors Algorithm. The model generated by each algorithm will be evaluated for precision and predictive accuracy. A selection of algorithms with the highest accuracy and precision scores will be evaluated further.

__Hypothesis:__ The patient’s medical history has a direct impact on the outcome of the IVF cycle.

## Data Source & Overview
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority collects data and statistics about over 70,000 fertility treatments performed each year in the UK. HFEA is an executive non-departmental public body of the Department of Health and Social Care in the United Kingdom. It is the UK’s independent regulator of fertility treatment and research using human embryos. HFEA is responsible for licensing, monitoring and inspecting fertility clinics.
By law, clinics have a duty to submit data on fertility treatments taking place and babies born as a result. To allow researchers to make good use of the data, an anonymised version of the Register is published.
Data used for this project is the latest available, it contains treatments from 2017 to 2018.

The original data can be accessed here: https://www.hfea.gov.uk/about-us/our-data/guide-to-the-anonymised-register/ .

## Cleaning & Processing

I followed a 6 step data cleaning process:

1. Removing the irrelevant data
2. Removing duplicates. 
3. Renaming the columns with model-friendly names.
4. Handling missing data.
5. Filtering out data outliers
6. Creating the target variable.

## Feature Engineering

The final features engineered into the core data set included:

- Patient’s age
- Partner’s age
- Number of previous pregnancies
- Number of previous live births
- Tubal disease
- Ovulatory disorder
- Male factor
- Endometriosis
- Unexplained infertility
- Stimulation used
- Sperm source
- Frozen cycle
- Egg source
- Embryos Transferred 
- Early outcome
- Live birth

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA process highlighted some interesting insights:

<sup>**Table 1:** _Bar charts represent the counts of Number of Previous Pregnancies and Number of Previous Live Birth._</sup>

Patients in the sample were likely to have had an unsuccessful pregnancy in the past. According to medical research: If you have been pregnant before, either with or without IVF, you may have a greater chance of getting pregnant again with IVF.

<sup>**Table 2:** _Bar charts represent the counts of causes of infertility._</sup>

For 1 in 3 couples, a cause cannot be identified. Unexplained infertility is when the cause remains unknown even after an infertility work-up, usually including semen analysis and assessment of ovulation and fallopian tubes in the woman.

About one half of couples have male factor causes.

<sup>**Table 3:** _The violin plots show the relationships between the early outcome of the IVF treatment and the number of previous IVF cycles._</sup>

'None' & 'Miscarriage' have a slightly higher density around 6 than other outcomes. IFPS has the highest density between 1 and 2.

There are some correlations between patients' and partners' ages but not enough to be an issue for modelling.

## Modelling
Predictions were performed using machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree Classifier and K-nearest Neighbors Algorithm and optimized with GridSearch. The model generated by each algorithm is evaluated for precision and predictive accuracy.

- Baseline: 57% of samples belong to the majority class 0, samples that did not result in a live birth.

## Results

I am looking at precision because it determines the correctness of our model. We can afford to miss a number of successful treatments(so recall score is less important), as long as our model is correct when predicting treatments that do end up successful.

Logistic Regression performed best in terms of accuracy score. Gradient boosted and Decision Tree stumps add extra machinery, so in this project Logistic regression will efficiently compute the best results.

The best precision score was achieved by Logistic Regression & Support-Vector Classifier. However, it took a lot longer for SVC to run and the interpretation of this model is not as transparent.

## Feature Importance

The relevant independent variables according to the positive coefficient: the number of embryos transferred, number of previous pregnancies & births, the source of sperm.

The relevant independent variables with negative coefficients: patient age (40-50), number of previous IVF cycles, endometriosis, tubal disease, ovulatory disorder, unexplained infertility and malefactor.



## Limitations
- Limited data on causes of infertility: infertility may be caused by a range of abnormalities of the ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, and endocrine system, among others. Only five features were available in the dataset in relation to causes of infertility.
- No data on the lifestyle of the patients: the crucial role that modifiable lifestyle factors play in the development of infertility have generated a growing interest in this field of study, i.e. ageing, psychological stress, nutrition, physical activity, caffeine, high scrotal temperature, hot water, mobile telephone use.
- Limited computing resources: the necessary time for running the algorithm gets higher as we increase the size of the data. 

## Recommendations

1. One of the most important factors that influence the success of IVF is a lifestyle. If one of the partners smokes excessively, the chances of conceiving are greatly reduced. Another lifestyle factor affecting IVF success rate is weight. Collecting and incorporating the data in relation to these factors would potentially improve the performance of the models.

2. Environmental factors also play an important role in the quality of eggs and sperm which are required for IVF success. It would be interesting to see how location data influence the modelling.

3. Perhaps one of the other interesting external factors is the clinic chosen by the couple for their treatment. For individual clinics, the potential areas that could be investigated further are the lab’s success rates to laboratory standards, air quality, and the experience of the embryologists.
